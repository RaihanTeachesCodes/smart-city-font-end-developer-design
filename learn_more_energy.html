            <p  style="margin-top: 0px;" id="jing">Renewable energy is an increasingly popular solution to the environmental problem of global warming due to its sustainability and efficiency. Solar panels are a popular choice for clean and sustainable electricity generation because solar panels do not create greenhouse gases or other harmful byproducts. It has been estimated that if the entire world used solar panels on all roofs, we would be able to produce enough energy for the whole world population about five times over.</p>

        <p id="jing2">This might sound like a far-fetched idea, but if you revisit our earlier calculations about how efficient this form of energy can be we can see that solar panels are currently a much better option than any other options
            Energy consumption is a major contributor to global warming.</p>

                It will also benefit in terms of labor as there will be fewer manual tasks that need to be completed on a daily basis.</p>
